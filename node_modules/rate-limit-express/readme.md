# Rate limiting:
+ Rate limit middleware to limit access.
+ Everytime a user sends a request to the server, ipaddress of the user is the key and the number of times visited is increased by one.
+ This function also sets of a callback function which gets triggered after **timelimit(second parameter)** seconds and reduces the number of times visited by one.
+ So we effectively keep the ipaddress and number of requests in the last **timelimit** seconds window.
+ If it is greater than the **requestlimits(firstparameter)**, we send an error message.
# Usage:
+ **const ratelimiter = require("rate-limit-express");**
+ **app.use(ratelimiter.ratelimit(5, 10));**
+ app is your Express app and first parameter is timelimit and second parameter is access limit
